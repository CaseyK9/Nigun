## Nigun (Medley)
RF down-converter for SDR

## PURPOSE
Allow low-frequency SDR (mainly RTL-SDR) to recieve wireless signals in frequencies higher than 1500MHz

## MAIN PROPERTIES
* Dynamic LO - LO will be determined by the user and programmed by the MCU
* Almost no filtering - will leave this challenge outside of this project scope 
* Power up and programming via micro-usb connector. Should be able to power up from a USB power-pack (but probably not from a computer port)

## DESIGN DETAILS
Can be found currently on http://slides.com/raziele/software-define-radio-4-5-6-7-8#/
All details should be updated here in the near future

## CURRENT STATUS
PCB design. Planning on ordering first prototype until the end of January 2017
