# Nigun
RF down-converter for SDR

# PURPOSE
Allow low-frequency SDR (mainly RTL-SDR) to recieve wireless signals in frequencies higher than 1500MHz

# MAIN PROPERTIES
## Dynamic LO - LO will be determined by the user and programmed by the MCU
## Almost no filtering - will leave this challenge outside of this project scope 
## Power up and programming via micro-usb connector. Should be able to power up from a USB power-pack (but probably not from a computer port)
